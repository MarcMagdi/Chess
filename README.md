# Chess
Chess is a multiplayer terminal game.

### Project Features: 
As a player I have the ability to:
+ Move my pieces to a valid place obeying international chess rules.
+ Promote my pawns to another piece [Queen, Rock, Bishop, Knight].
+ Castle either King side or Queen side.
+ Undo & Redo as many moves as I want during the game.
+ Save the current state of the game to an external text file and load it later any time.

The game is ended either by a Checkmate or a Stalmate.
